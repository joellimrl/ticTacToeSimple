# Developer note

Almost everything in this project (including everything above) was generated by AI, using Github Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4)

The process is as follows:
1. Wrote a `transcript.md` file containing what i wanted to do and placed it in `docs > transcript`
2. Generated a series of user stories (`docs > stories`)
3. Generated an implementation plan (`docs > feature`)
   1. There is usually 1 plan per story but since this project is rather simple it got aggregated into a single file
4. Execute the implementation plan
5. Run the project and suggest any improvements
   1. Restart button during the game was originally not there, along with some slight UI fixes
