# User Story: 6 - Interactive Game Grid

**As a** player,
**I want** to click on empty squares to place my X marker,
**so that** I can make my moves in the tic-tac-toe game.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Clicking on an empty square places the player's X marker
*   Clicking on occupied squares has no effect
*   Each square can only be clicked once per game
*   Game immediately processes the computer's response after player's move
*   Grid visually updates to show both player and computer moves

## Notes
