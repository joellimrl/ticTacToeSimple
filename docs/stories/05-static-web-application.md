# User Story: 5 - Static Web Application

**I want** to access the tic-tac-toe game through any web browser without requiring server setup,
**so that** I can play the game easily from any device with a browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Game runs entirely in the browser (client-side)
*   Game can be opened directly from file system or hosted on any static web server
*   All game logic and AI functionality works offline

## Notes
