# User Story: 1 - Play Against Computer

**As a** player,
**I want** to play tic-tac-toe against a computer opponent,
**so that** I can enjoy the game even when no other human players are available.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Player always plays as X and moves first
*   Computer always plays as O and responds after player's move
*   Computer makes the best possible move based on current board state
*   Game alternates turns between player and computer
*   Game ends when there's a winner or the board is full (draw)

## Notes

*   Computer AI should be simple but effective
*   AI should analyze current board state to determine optimal move
*   Game should be playable immediately without additional setup
