# User Story: 3 - Visual Move Preview

**As a** player,
**I want** to see a preview of my X marker when hovering over empty squares,
**so that** I can clearly understand where my move will be placed before clicking.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Hovering over an empty square shows an outline of the X that will be placed
*   Hover effect only appears on empty, clickable squares
*   Hover effect disappears when mouse leaves the square
*   Hover effect is visually distinct from actual placed markers
*   Hover effect works consistently across the game

## Notes

*   Should provide clear visual feedback without being distracting
*   Hover state should be intuitive and responsive
*   Effect should not interfere with game readability
