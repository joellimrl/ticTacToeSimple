I want to create a simple tic tac toe browser based app that allows a user to play against a computer. it should be a static site built using only html, css and javascript. there should be a very simple and rudimentary set of rules that mimics an AI that plays against the player.
for every move the player make, decide the best possible move based on the current board and execute that move. the player will always play as X and the computer will always play as O.
the design of the site should be responsive and adjust accordingly for both mobile and desktop. there should be no other buttons on the site except for the tic tac toe grid. when the user hovers over each square on the grid, there should be an outline of the X that will be placed there if the user clicks. the rest of the colours and background should be plain and simple and use earth tones.
